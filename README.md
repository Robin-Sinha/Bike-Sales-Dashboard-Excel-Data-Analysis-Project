# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Excel-Data-Analysis-Project
Created an interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes buying behavior across demographics, income brackets, and commute patterns. The project demonstrates end-to-end Excel data analysis—from cleaning and transformation to visualization and insight generation.
**Steps Taken:**
Data Cleaning: Applied filters to identify blank rows, removed duplicates, standardized categorical columns, and ensured data consistency.

Data Preparation: Grouped the Age column into brackets for better filtering and analysis, removed currency symbols from Income for accurate calculations, and used conditional formatting on Age and Children for easy visualization.

Data Modeling: Created multiple Pivot Tables and Charts summarizing sales by region, income, gender, and commute distance.

Dashboard Creation: Combined all visuals in a dedicated Dashboard sheet, added slicers for interactive filtering (Region, Occupation, Age Bracket, etc.), and connected all charts using Report Connections for seamless interactivity.

**--Key Insights:**
Regional Trends: North America leads bike purchases (50.8%), followed by Europe (30%) and the Pacific (19.2%).

Demographics: Adults (31–55 years) form 72% of all buyers, highlighting this age group as the core customer base.

Income Patterns: Most purchases occur among customers earning 40K–70K, indicating mid-income consumers drive demand.

Commute Behavior: 37% of buyers commute within 1 mile—suggesting bikes are mainly used for short-distance travel or recreation.

Education & Occupation: Individuals with Bachelor’s or Partial College education dominate sales, especially professionals and skilled workers.

Gender Balance: Purchases are nearly even between males (51%) and females (49%), with males showing slightly higher buying tendencies at higher income levels.
